When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working collaboritively with others it can be good to use github. Also it can serve as a back up for your own files
should your computer ever crash.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well, maybe you don't want them automatically pulled because you just are done, and you 
want all commits to stay where they are, while others are continuing to add commits on 
the project?
