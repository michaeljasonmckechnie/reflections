When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working collaboritively with others it can be good to use github. Also it can serve as a back up for your own files
should your computer ever crash.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well, maybe you don't want them automatically pulled because you just are done, and you 
want all commits to stay where they are, while others are continuing to add commits on 
the project?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are GitHubs' version of their in cloud cloning, you may want to fork a project
because you don't have permission to commit to the official project. Clones are local
copies of a project. While branches are just seperate paths in the tree structure on 
any given project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Go to stay up to date as much as possible when working collaboritively.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaboration without github would require that everyone knows exactly what they're 
supposed to be working on, and not going beyond their own scope. Without git it 
might be easier to keep everyone focused on their own tasks, but updating files
could potentially be a downfall of this method as well.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you have an idea that isn't fully baked yet and you want to keep the 
master branch working the way it was intended.
