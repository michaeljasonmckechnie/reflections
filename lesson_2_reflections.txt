What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a hidden folder where all of
the committs are stored. You need it so that all the data is collected 
for each committ that you instantiate.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository
? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is everything that is in a current directory, the staging 
area is everything that is in the pwd that is going to be committed. This allow
s you to choose what you want to be committed to the .git directory.
